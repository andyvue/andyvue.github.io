            <p>Hello, my name is Andy. I am a junior majoring in 
                Information Sciences. Some of my hobbies are cooking 
                and playing games with my friends. Over the summer I 
                went to Sea World in Florida where I got to see the 
                whale show as well as visiting a theme park called Old 
                Town Road. What I think are qualities of a bad website 
                are features that makes your user experience uncomfortable. 
                For example, Youtube not only increase their number of ads, 
                but also made it much longer. In addition, they made it so 
                that for some ads, you can not even skip on. Youtube's 
                excessive ads are what I think are qualities of a bad website 
                because of how much it affects my user experience.</p>
