            <p>In a previous statistics class, my group analyzed 
                the FBIâ€™s 2013 hate crime dataset, which included 
                crime type, time of occurrence, state, agency, and 
                population for a final project. We compiled total 
                hate crimes by state, combined all categories, and 
                normalized the data by calculating hate crimes per 
                capita.</p>

            <p> To visualize our findings, we created a sorted bar plot 
            ranking states by median hate crime rate per capita. Each 
            data point represented an agency, helping highlight 
            disparities and trends across different states. This 
            visualization was exploratory, allowing us to uncover 
            patterns in hate crime distribution. It followed good 
            data visualization practices by presenting clear, structured, 
            and normalized data, making comparisons easy.</p>

            <p>As a member of Lambda Phi Epsilon in the spring of 
            2024, I helped host a collaborative event with a Hmong 
            Student Organization called HASA called Date Auction. We 
            raised money for our prospective philanthropies.</p>
